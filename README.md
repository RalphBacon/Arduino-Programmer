We're all used to programming an Arduino board using just a single USB cable, but what do you do when you want a bespoke PCB with an ATMega328P (Arduino Uno chip) in it? How do you program it? And run it without a crystal?

Using a couple of cheap (as a cup of coffee house coffee) tools we can program any ATMEGA328P chip (and several others besides, but let's not get ahead of ourselves).

These bit of electronic wizardry let us but new bootloaders, change the *fuses* (one bit flags) on the chip to alter its hardware behaviour and, of course, let us upload our latest and greatest compiled sketch.

I'm telling you all this so that you can be prepared for the next raft of projects I'm embarking on and that you might want to modify for your own purposes. To program the chips, you'll need these simple tools. Buy once, have for life!

Oh yes, I also recorded about 30 minutes of video on how to convert a circuit diagram to a PCB, and all the steps you need to take, but this is still lying on the cutting room floor. There was basicially no time left to include this quite detailed information, so we'll leave that for another day.

I'd love your comments, questions and general constructive observations so please feel free to comment on the video.

Here are the links to (most) of the products we looked at in the video. Some may be affiliate links that help my channel. Others are not but I don't discriminate either way.
